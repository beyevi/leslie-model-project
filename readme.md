## About the project
This is the final project in the Linear Algebra course, taught during the $2^{nd}$ year of the Applied Sciences Faculty in the Ukrainian Catholic University, Lviv.

The aim of the project is to apply what has been learnt during the course on real-world problems. In this case, we decided to implement the Leslie model without using built-in methods.

## Languages used
For experimental purposes, we decided to use *Python* and *Julia* in order to compare the effectiveness of chosen languages for data and matrix manipulations. Code implementations in each language are stored in corresponding folders.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Julia 1.10.2+

## Installation
Required packages for both languages are stored in `dependencies` folder. Don't forget to move to the folder by running:
```
> cd dependencies
```

To install the required packages for Python code, run the following in your command line:
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To install the required packages for Julia code, run the following in your command line:
```
> julia
> ] instantiate
```
---
After installing all packages, your code is ready to run.
